# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working with [William T. Freeman](http://billf.mit.edu/) and a Visiting Scientist at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://cfa.harvard.edu/). 
  I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, where I was advised by [Amitabh Varshney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Varshney) and worked closely with [Christopher A. Metzler](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~metzler/) and [Jia-Bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/).

  My research develops AI as a "lens" to reveal hidden worlds embedded in physical phenomena.
  My North Star is to build intelligent systems that, rather than merely mirroring human perception, process information guided by the underlying physics of light.
  In doing so, I aim to expand the boundaries of scientific discovery and transform how we understand the physical world, both near and faraway.
