I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Maryland advised by [Prof. Amitabh Varshney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Varshney). My research focus lies at the intersection of graphics, vision, and imaging. I develop machine learning algorithms for image and 3D data processing, with applications ranging from mixed reality to natural science. My goal is to enhance our ability to represent and perceive information about our world, facilitating new creation with positive societal impact.</subtitle></feed>
